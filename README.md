I'm a casual developer mostly interested in gnu/linux and open source, currently studying Information technology at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology
I'm from Melbourne, Australia.
I'm 27 years old.
I've used a lot of different distros over my time with linux, but I eventually settled on SUSE and Debian.
